/*
13_phong.vert: Vertex shader for the Phong and Blinn-Phong illumination model

N. B.) the shader treats a simplified situation, with a single point light.
For more point lights, a for cycle is needed to sum the contribution of each light
For different kind of lights, the computation must be changed (for example, a directional light is defined by the direction of incident light, so the lightDir is passed as uniform and not calculated in the shader like in this case with a point light).
